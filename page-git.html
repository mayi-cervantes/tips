          <h3>Tips for Git</h3>
          <p>Git is one of, if not <em>the</em>, most popular version control systems available at the moment. Everyone knows about GitHub and the huge amount of software that is available there to play around with, and this is continuing to drive more people to get started with it.</p>
          <p>However, while Git can be very useful, it does come with a few challenges. What is the best way to setup your branch scheme? Should I use pull requests or give others access to commit to my repo? How do I use Git from a terminal? These are only a few of the questions we have seen recently, with many more being asked all the time.</p>
